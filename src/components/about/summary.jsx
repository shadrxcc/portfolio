        Having had a bit of experience in design, i&apos;m fascinated and have a
        keen eye for clean designs which gives me a unique perspective towards
        frontend development. I couple my enthusiasm for good designs alongside
        technical skills to create seamless user experiences using frontend technologies. </p>
